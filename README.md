### _**What is it all about?**_

One of the main objectives of this project is offering your engineering team the opportunity to develop a framework in hardware and software, that will enable game developers to design new excitatory, attractive games.

Image the following case. Several competing teams will be dropped in a for them less familiar environment, for instance a lesser known city. The team-members of each competing team could be or could not be familiar with the orientation, structure, topology ... of this particular city.

Each team will be equipped with a _gaming box_, including the necessary electronics to communicate with a central dispatching center, supervised by a game master. Anytime a game master can monitor the status of the competing teams, define new assignments, reward or sanction specific teams, according to their performance and results.

An example of a simple game could be described as follows.

Two competing teams receive on the display of their gaming box a different starting point in a chosen city. The starting point is determined by the game master and contains the GPS coordinates of the exact location. This starting point could be defined as **location marker A**. Image that the teams are assigned with the challenge to travel a trajectory, containing several location markers \(location marker B, location marker C, ...\), within a dedicated short time interval.

When a team reaches a certain marker location, it is mandatory to 'proof' that they haved reached the correct location, within a defined time interval. They could for example take some photos of the environment and upload the images to a webserver, that can be evaluated and followed by the game master. The teams have also the ability to save and capture crucial data \(text, images, ...\) in the gaming box. Each marker location can be accompanied with a specific task or set of tasks, defined by the game master. The update of the game instructions could for instance be established by the communication between game master and gaming teams. An alternative could be the uploading of a configuration file in the embedded system of the gaming box before the start of the game.

The winner will be the team that is able to flawlessly perform as much as possible tasks assigned at the different location markers, within the predefined time interval.

Let's take the city of Ostend as an example. The challenge for **team A** could be:

1. start at 8:45 AM at  '**Fort Napoleon** Oostende' - solve some puzzles or issues, concerning Fort Napoleon and it's history within 15 minutes
2. go to the **railway station** of Ostend - the deadline is 9:45 AM - solve some puzzles or issues, within 30 minutes

3. go to '**Cultuurcentrum De Post**' - the deadline is 10:45 AM - solve some puzzles or issues, within 20 minutes

4. go to '**Kinepolis** Ostend' - the deadline is 11:30 AM - solve some puzzels or issues, within 10 minutes

5. return to the base camp at **Katholieke Hogeschool VIVES** as fast as possible, to be evaluated by the game master and indeed to claim the victory of your team!

As an example, a number of location markers \(marker B and C\) are visualized in **Figure 1**.

Naturally, you should be able to compose other thrilling 'compete - go - track' games or variants of the above described city game.
