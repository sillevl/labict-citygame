# Project Requirements

##  Minimum requirements

The **minimum requirements** to be achieved in this project are:

* Cover a  trajectory, defined by a sequence of minimum 3 selected checkpoints, within a predefined period of time
* Possibility to play puzzels, riddles, or questions at checkpoint locations before giving the details about the next checkpoint.
* The ability to upload metadata \(strings\) or media \(files, photos, ...\) to a web server
* Develop at least one \(city\) game.
* The game(s) must be dynamically loaded, not statically programmed in code.
* Two players or groups must be able to compete against another and/or cooperate with others.
* Scores or times should be comparable between different groups who played the same game.
* Data or state must be sent from the case to the server.
* Battery powered.

## Restrictions

* Battery must last for minimum 6 hours. Battery must stay in place when recharging trough an USB connector.
* Use object oriented programming languages for both the firmware as software.
* Communication between the cases and the server must use the LoRaWAN communication protocol.


## Valuable expansions

* Data or state can be send from the server to the cases.
* Multiple types of games, ranging from time, distance and difficulty can be created and played.
* Generate random games based on a set of restrictions
* Use your imagination and creativity. **Suggestions are welcome and will be appreciated**.

## Approach

The project could be subdivided in four major parts:

1. hardware and hardware device drivers
2. firmware with game logic
3. game generator
4. Graphical User Interface, database and database management system

Each topic must be subdivided into smaller topics. *Each student* should be engaged in *at least one* of these four major project parts. If the sub-project, in which you are involved, is finished, you should join your colleagues to support their design team. Developers can switch teams when priorities shift during the project. After all, the success of the global project depends on each cooperator!

To meet the objectives of the project, some requirements are mandatory:

* Define and accept only **SMART **objectives \(Specific Measurable Acceptable Realistic Time Bound\)
* Plan Ahead, Plan wise. Therefore a Project Management System is the ideal support tool to enable this task. The project will be managed by **Redmine**.
* Efficient distribution and follow-up of tasks within the design team
* Agile **SCRUM **Software Development Methodology
* Efficient and streamlined communication between team members, peer-to-peer, bottom-up and top-down
* Peer assessment

## Git

All code and progress should be managed using Git. [github.com](https://github.com) can be used to create repositories and organize collaboration. 

Note: Even failed experiments or code not used in the end result must be stored in git repositories.

## Redmine

URL: [http://project.labict.be/](http://project.labict.be/ "Redmine - Project Management System")

> **Redmine** is a flexible project management web application. Written using the Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database.

The first session, a detailed planning must be made for the full length of time for the project. Each member must have at least one task assigned to himself at any moment during the creation of the project.

At the end of each project day an evaluation will be made for each group based on the planning and logs of Redmine. Fine-tuning of the planning will be needed as the project advanced to paint a realistic picture of the progress and current state of the project.

> If it's not in the logs, it never happened !

## Report

Reporting is done through this document on gitbook. It does have to adhere to a certain structure:

* index page with abstract and table of contents
* introduction
* actual content
* costings
* conclusions
* sources (where you got your information)
* attachments (images, schematics, code, ...) (can be uploaded in documents / files)

Gitbook will be locked 1 week after the final presentation; so Wednesday the 24th of May 2017. This means you will not be able change anything anymore after this date.

## Final Presentation

Each group will need to give a presentation of their project in the last week (Wednesday the 17th of May 2017). In this presentation you need to give an overview of the work performed and final result.

This final presentation consists of:

* 20 minutes of PowerPoint presentation
* 5 minutes of questions from the audience
* 10 minutes of demonstration
* Every member of the group should take part in the final presentation.

## Roadmap

* Thursday 9/2	       8h45 – 16h30
* Wednesday 15/3	8h45 – 16h30
* Wednesday 22/3	13h30 – 16h30
* Wednesday 26/4	8h45 – 16h30
* Wednesday 3/5	8h45 – 16h30
* Wednesday 10/5	8h45 – 16h30
* Wednesday 17/5	8h45 – 16h30 -> **Final Presentation**
