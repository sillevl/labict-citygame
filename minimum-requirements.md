# Minimum requirements

The **minimum requirements** to be achieved in this project are:

* Cover a  trajectory, defined by a sequence of minimum 3 selected marker locations, within a predefined period of time
* Validation of the position of the marker locations
* The ability to upload metadata \(strings\) or media \(files, photos, ...\) to a web server
* Develop at least one \(city\) game.
* The game(s) must be dynamically configured, not statically programmed in code.

The project could be subdivided in four major parts:

1. hardware and hardware device drivers
2. firmware with game logic
3. game generator
4. Graphical User Interface, database and database management system

Each topic must be subdivided into smaller topics. *Each student* should be engaged in *at least one* of these four major project parts. If the sub-project, in which you are involved, is finished, you should join your colleagues to support their design team. Developers can switch teams when priorities shift during the project. After all, the success of the global project depends on each cooperator!

To meet the objectives of the project, some requirements are mandatory:

* Define and accept only **SMART **objectives \(Specific Measurable Acceptable Realistic Time Bound\)
* Plan Ahead, Plan wise. Therefore a Project Management System is the ideal support tool to enable this task. The project will be managed by **Redmine**.
* Efficient distribution and follow-up of tasks within the design team
* Agile **SCRUM **Software Development Methodology
* Efficient and streamlined communication between team members, peer-to-peer, bottom-up and top-down
* Peer assessment
