# Minimum requirements

The **minimum requirements** to be achieved in this project are:

* Cover a  trajectory, defined by a sequence of selected marker locations, within a predefined period of time
* Validation of the position of the marker locations
* The ability to upload metadata \(strings\) or media \(files, photos, ...\) to a web server
* Develop at least one \(city\) game

The project could be subdivided in four major parts:

1. hardware and hardware device drivers
2. firmware with game logic
3. game generator
4. Graphical User Interface, database and database management system

Each student should be engaged in at least one of these four major project parts. If the sub-project, in wich you are involved, is finished, you should join your colleagues to support their design team. After all, the succes of the global project depents on each cooperator!

To meet the objectives of the project, some requirements are mandatory:

* Define and accept only **SMART **objectives \(Specific Measurable Acceptable Realistic Time Bound\)
* Plan Ahead, Plan wise. Therefore a Project Management System is the ideal support tool to enable this task. The project will be managed by **Redmine**.
* Efficient distribution and follow-up of tasks within the design team
* Agile **SCRUM **Software Development Methodology
* Efficient and streamlined communication between team members, peer-to-peer, bottom-up and top-down
* Peer assessment
