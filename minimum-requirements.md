# Minimum requirements

The **minimum requirements** to be achieved in this project are:

* Cover a  trajectory, defined by a sequence of minimum 3 selected marker locations, within a predefined period of time
* Validation of the position of the marker locations
* The ability to upload metadata \(strings\) or media \(files, photos, ...\) to a web server
* Develop at least one \(city\) game.
* The game(s) must be dynamically configured, not statically programmed in code.

The project could be subdivided in four major parts:

1. hardware and hardware device drivers
2. firmware with game logic
3. game generator
4. Graphical User Interface, database and database management system

Each topic must be subdivided into smaller topics. *Each student* should be engaged in *at least one* of these four major project parts. If the sub-project, in which you are involved, is finished, you should join your colleagues to support their design team. Developers can switch teams when priorities shift during the project. After all, the success of the global project depends on each cooperator!

To meet the objectives of the project, some requirements are mandatory:

* Define and accept only **SMART **objectives \(Specific Measurable Acceptable Realistic Time Bound\)
* Plan Ahead, Plan wise. Therefore a Project Management System is the ideal support tool to enable this task. The project will be managed by **Redmine**.
* Efficient distribution and follow-up of tasks within the design team
* Agile **SCRUM **Software Development Methodology
* Efficient and streamlined communication between team members, peer-to-peer, bottom-up and top-down
* Peer assessment

At the end of each project day an evaluation will be made for each group based on the planning and logs of Redmine. Fine-tuning of the planning will be needed as the project advanced to paint a realistic picture of the progress and current state of the project.

> If it's not in the logs, it never happened !

## Final Presentation

Each group will need to give a presentation of their project in the last week (Wednesday the 17th of May 2017). In this presentation you need to give an overview of the work performed and final result.

This final presentation consists of:

* 20 minutes of PowerPoint presentation
* 5 minutes of questions from the audience
* 10 minutes of demonstration
* Every member of the group should take part in the final presentation.
