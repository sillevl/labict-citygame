# View all Bookings

## Partial

After someone created a booking, then the booking will be visible on the adminpanel. All the bookings will be displayed in the "View all the bookings" partial.

### Display information

The information from the booking is displayed by getting the information out of the database. Let's have a look what's inside the collection of the bookings. First we have an "oid", this is some kind of large string of random numbers and characters generated by the database \(MongoDB\). Everything under the "oid" is the information that we want to display in the partial. \(See UML below of the collection Booking\)

For getting the information, we needed to create some getters. The getter in the green box \(getAllBookings\) is used for getting al the bookings that are created by people who want to play the game. Once we had all the bookings, we used the getters in the red box to display the information on the screen. These getters will get the individual parts from a booking. These individual parts will be forwarded to the partial by giving it to the routes. These routes are some sort of connection between the php class and the html partial. Now that the html partial have access to the individual parts of the booking, we can use twig to displayed it on the screen. Twig is a flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP.
