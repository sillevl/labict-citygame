# Adminpanel

The adminpanel is a page for admins. They can check all the bookings that have been made and can accapt them or deny them \(left partial of the screen\). When a booking have been accpeted, then it will create a new game that can be edited by them \(right partial of the screen\). The game can also be deleted for example if they accepted the wrong booking.
