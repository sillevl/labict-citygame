#### Aboutpage

For our aboutpage, we've included an `<iframe>` with the content of the GitBook. Many attempt were made with CSS to resize the iframe but we ended up using JavaScript. Window is resized with this code below.

```js
$( document ).ready(function() {
  if(window.location.pathname == "/about") {
    console.log("iFrame sizing should be executed");
    function scaleIframe(){
      window.updateIframe = function() {
        var h = $(window).height();
        $("#iframe").height(h-56);
      }
      window.updateIframe();
    }
    $(window).resize(scaleIframe);
    $(window).onload = scaleIframe();
    console.log("iFrame sizing was executed");
  }
});
```

#### Controlpanel

A bug on the controlpanel is present as seen at the bottom of the screenshot. The `<progress> </progress>` is not shown by the footer. The footer is a part of [Foundation's 6.3.1 topbar](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/top-bar.html) because we couldn't find a footer provided by Foundation. The footer is not functional when viewed on a smartphone, the tablet version however, does not have this problem.
