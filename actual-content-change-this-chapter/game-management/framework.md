# Slim Framework

We use [Slim Framework 3](https://www.slimframework.com/) as a framework for our project,  
Slim is a PHP micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.  
Slim also support extensions, we used the following:
- [slim-controller](https://packagist.org/packages/martynbiz/slim3-controller)
Provides controller functionality to Slim Framework v3.
- [slim/twig-view](https://packagist.org/packages/slim/twig-view)
Slim Framework 3 view helper built on top of the Twig 2 templating component
- [monolog](https://packagist.org/packages/monolog/monolog)
Sends your logs to files, sockets, inboxes, databases and various web services
- [slim-session](https://packagist.org/packages/bryanjhv/slim-session)
Session middleware and helper for Slim framework 3.
- [mongodb/mongodb](https://packagist.org/packages/mongodb/mongodb)
MongoDB driver library
- [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://packagist.org/packages/vlucas/phpdotenv)
Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` automagically.
- [phpmailer/phpmailer](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer)
PHPMailer is a full-featured email creation and transfer class for PHP
- [webmozart/json](https://packagist.org/packages/webmozart/json)
A robust JSON decoder/encoder with support for schema validation.

We also added a own implementation around the mongodb/mongodb library for a easier to use database access.  
And the slim-session is used in our key class and middleware to automaticly log users in without having to do it in each route.  
monolog will log each request to a page (not a file) in the `logs/app.log` file with:  
- method
- schema
- host
- port
- path
- key
- keytype
