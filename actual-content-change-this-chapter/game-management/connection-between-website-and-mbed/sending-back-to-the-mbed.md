## **Sending **
We can also send data back to the MBED but this isn't a lot of data just some bytes.
For this we needed to encode our JSON to base64 so that the hardware could decode it to make any sense out of the data.
But as it stands now they don't use it.
It can be used for future use but now it isn't implemented in the final project.
