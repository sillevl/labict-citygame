# **TTN library**
![](/assets/mqttexplained.PNG)
In this section I will explain thethingsnetwork library.
TTN uses MQTT but it's made abstract so that I dont know how the mqtt exactly works.
I only need to call the functions to make the library work.
This makes it much easier for us.
I won't explain the MQTT here, Donovan already did that.
To connect to thethingsnetwork you'll need the accesskey of your device.

## **How to install the library?**
You'll need NPM and powershell for this.
(you can download npm and nodejs here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm)
When you have installed NPM, go to the folder where you want to use the library, open up powershell there and in powershell type: "npm install --save ttn" to install the ttn library.
