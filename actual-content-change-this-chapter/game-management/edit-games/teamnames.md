# Teamnames

## Partial

In the page where you can edit the game, there is a partial where you can add teamnames to the database. This partial is called "Choose amund of teams".  It is not entirely finished due the lack of time and focus on the required parts of the project.            \(See pictures below\)

## Submit 

When you have filled in the teamnames and chose a mbed \(case\), then you press submit to send it to the database. It sends it in the form of an array that contains the teamname and the case. The left UML represents the teamnames class and the right UML represents the connection teamnames from the database. For getting the teamnames in the database, we use the "save\(\)" method from the teamnames class. In the collection, you can see the arrays that are created from the teamnames and cases for each team.

This part works but is not connected to the game yet. It can easily implemented if we had some more time for this project.
