# Database

## Intro

The database has the function to save the data from a game. This data is the booking information, a whole game, the login code.  
In this project we're using mongoDB as database because it makes it simple to manage the data.

## mongoDB

mongoDB is a NoSQL Database. This means that data is modeled an other way than the tabular relations used in relational databases. mongoDB has an JSON structure.
