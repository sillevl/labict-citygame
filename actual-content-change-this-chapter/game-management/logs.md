monolog will log each request to a page \(not a file\) in the `logs/app.log` file with:

example:

```

```

explenation:

```
[DATE TIME] slim-app.INFO: METHOD=>SCHEME://HOST:PORT/PATH with key: KEY (KEYTYPE) [] {"uid":"PHP\_REQUEST\_ID"}
```

or this one from a api post from the game creators:  
\(this one shows the purpuse of the HOST in the log, as the same server can be accessed from multiple diffrent hosts\)

```
