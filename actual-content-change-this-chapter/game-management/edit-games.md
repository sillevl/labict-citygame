# Edit Games

## Partial

After that the admin accepted a booking, then a new game will be created with the booking info. The booking info that is now in the new game is dispayed in the "Edit games" partial.

### Display information

The information from the new game is displayed by getting the information out of the database. Let's have a look what's inside the collection of the games. First we have an "oid", this is some kind of large string of random numbers and characters generated by the database \(MongoDB\). the information in the red box will be displayed in the partial. \(See UML below of the collection game\)

For getting the information, we needed to create some getters. The getter in the green box \(getAll\) is used for getting al the games \(all the accepted bookings that made a new game\) from the collection game. Once we had all the games, we used the getters in the red box to display the information on the screen. These getters will get the individual parts from the game \(we only wanted to display the booking information, because a scenario still has to be picked\). These individual parts will be forwarded to the partial by giving it to the routes. These routes are some sort of connection between the php class and the html partial. Now that the html partial have access to the individual parts of the game, we can use twig to displayed it on the screen. Twig is a flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP.

### Delete button

When you press on the delete button of a specific game, then the game will be deleted out of the database. The method that we created for deleting the specific game is delete\(\) \(See picture below\). It deletes the game by searching for the matching "oid" of the specific game that you want to delete.
