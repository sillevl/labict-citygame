You'll see the keys on your left side.
The keys are randomly generated.
They are linked with each accepted game, so every game has their unique set of keys for teams and the gamemaster.
The keys are generated when you choose a scenario and if you link the mbed to the teamnames provided by the teams.
After this they are inserted into the login collection, together with the function of the keys(team or master).
