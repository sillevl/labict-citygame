The hardware is very nice.

The projects uses Li-ion batteries which operate at :
    
<li>
    <ol>A minimum voltage of 2,8V</ol>
    <ol>A maximum discharge current of 4400mA</ol>
</li>    
The battery managment system accomodates these specifications :
<li>
    <ol>A minimum voltage is provided through the use of a differential             amplifier, the reference voltage is provided by a zener diode.</ol>
</li>
<li>
    <ol>A maximum discharge current is safeguarded through the means of a DC-DC boost step-up converter. As this enables us to limit the maximum current, throught the use of external passive components.</ol>
</li>
