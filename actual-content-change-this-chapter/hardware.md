The hardware is very nice.

The projects uses Li-ion batteries which operate at :
    
<li>
    <ol>A minimum voltage of 2,8V</ol>
    <ol>A maximum discharge current of 4400mA</ol>
</li>    
The battery managment system accomodates these specifications.
    <li>
    <ol>A minimum voltage is provided through the use of a differential             amplifier, the reference voltage is provided by a zener diode.</ol>
</li>
