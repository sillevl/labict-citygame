- *setBacklight:*
        float value between 1 and 0, 1 = 100% backlight and 0 = 0% backlight
        This method changes the pwm value that controls a transistor that controls the backlight leds.
        note: reduce backilght to preserve battery life

- *setTime:*
        Sets the time for the topbar.

- *setStatusBattery:*
        Float between 1 and 0, 1 is 100% battery 0 is 0% battery.
