## PCB Design

All these components need to be connected to each other. The PCB handles this.

### Main PCB
#### Schematic

This is the complete schematic. I will go into detail about some parts of the schematic. 

##### I2C Expander JST
In the top left there are the JST connectors for I2C expansion. The led board is also connecting to the main board via one of these. 

##### Solder Jumpers
There are solder jumpers in the schematic due to the addition of another Lora chip. We added the possibility to use the Microchip Lora chip that uses Serial for its communication. The serial pins were already in use by the GPS so we had to use other ones. There is a second serial available but these are once again already used for I2C communication. So these jumpers are meant to select between the normal I2C or the secondary I2C. This way it is still possible to use the Microchip Lora.

##### EEPROM
There is an 1M EEPROM available that communicates via I2C. But this one has not been used in the current implementation of the firmware. The memory could be used to store a json file.

##### Switch & Buttons
These are also connected via JST headers. I used a normal pull down config here.

##### Buzzer
The buzzer is driven by a transistor. The base of this transistor is attached to a PWM port. This way it is fairly simple to generate a frequency.

##### LCD
The LCD is attached in 4 bit mode. This means that the 8 bit commands are sent in two parts. This saves quite some pins. One thing I forgot to do in the first revisions of the PCB is to pull the R/W pin to GND. This was the reason why the LCD didn't work. 

##### GPS
The GPS is on the bottom right. There is a backup battery clip that makes it possible to hot start the GPS chip. This way it takes a lot less time to find its GPS info. The reason behind this is that the chip can remember its time. And that is a key component in calculating its distance to various satellites. We are also using the GPS chip as an RTC for the application.

##### Keypad
Above the GPS chip is the keypad. All the rows are pulled down with a resistor. The rows have diode in series which we did not use afterward. I thought this was necessary because there could be a short if the column pins are on a different voltage level and you would press two buttons at the same time.  

##### Lora
Above the keypad is the Lora chip. It connects to the Mbed via SPI. We are not using the reset but there is a jumper connected to use this in the future if necessary.

##### Lora Chip 2
There is a second lora chip above the previous one. This is the other Microchip version. You can choose which one you want to use. Just keep in mind that the on board solder jumpers have to be changed then. 

  
#### Board
Top Layer:

On the front side of the PCB there isn't much. We did this on purpose to make it easy to debug when the board is mounted. As you also may notice, the GPS chip (top left) and the Lora chip (underneath) are placed very close to the edge. That is because the chips has to be as close as possible to the SMA connector to make sure there is no interference on the signal. That is also the reason why there are vias around the signal trace, this forms a sort of shielding.

On the bottom there are most of the components. The MBED mounts here and also all the JST connectors.

### Led Board
#### Schematic
![](/assets/Afbeelding5.png)

The led board schematic is pretty straight forward. The only thing to note on this are the pin names on the leds. When troubleshooting a led I found that these are incorrect. 
R1 is the resistor that is being used to set the constant current for the leds. I recommend choosing a resistor with a value equal to or higher than 1K. 

#### Board

Also the board layout is nothing special. The only thing is that the chip is pretty hard to solder with a normal soldering iron. It is recommended to use a very fine sharp tip or to reflow solder these.
