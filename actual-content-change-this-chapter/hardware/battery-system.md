# Battery Managment System

### Theoretical implementation

The projects uses Li-ion batteries \(the ones we used were the ICR18650-22F\) which operate at :

The battery management system accommodates for these specifications:

* A minimum voltage is provided through the use of a differential amplifier configured in open loop gain, the reference voltage is provided by a 3V zener diode which is then aplied to the inverting input op the opamp.  
  This enables the batteries to not fall below their minimum discharge cut-off voltage of 2,75V as the opamp will have a positive saturation voltage at the output whenever the batteries fall below 3V. A diode protects the mosfets from a negative saturation voltage, ensuring that the mosfets only decouple the batteries whenever they fall below 3V.

* A maximum discharge current is safeguarded through the means of a DC-DC boost step-up converter. As this enables us to limit the maximum current, through the use of external passive components. As well as specifying a  fixed output voltage unanymous of the load needed at an interval. The one issued in this design is a TPS61251. \(More information about the TPS61251 can be found at : [http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61251.pdf\](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61251.pdf\)\)

Lastly as a means to enable communication between the battery managment system and the microcontroller itself, an analog digital converter with an I²C interface was implemented. This basically captures the voltage level of the battery at a certain interval, then codes this analog voltage into a digital code ready for transmission over the I²C line of SDA right to the microcontroller for delivery. The ADC with I²C interface issued in this design is the  ADC081C027 more information can be found at : [http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/adc081c027.pdf](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/adc081c027.pdf)



### Practical implementation

#### Measuring the drawn current during operation 

##### Mode \#1 : Normal operation batteries charges above discharge cut off voltage threshold

\*The multimeter reads 17,98mA

##### Mode \#2 : Batteries are insufficiently charged and have a voltage below that of the discharge cut off voltage threshold

\*The multimeter reads 9,31mA

#### Measuring the output voltage of the Battery Managment System

##### Mode \#1 : Normal operation batteries charges above discharge cut off voltage threshold

\*The multimeter reads 4,49V, this should be 5V but due to some tolerances in the used components the practical output voltage was 4,5V instead of the calculated 5V. Having used E12 resistors didn't exactly aid in this.

##### Mode \#2 : Batteries are insufficiently charged and have a voltage below that of the discharge cut off voltage threshold

\*The multimeter reads 3,89V

As a consequence of being cut off from the batteries \(mosfets switched to a high impedance state\), the capacitors of the DC-DC boost converter will gradually give of their amassed voltage over time and thus result in a discharge and drop of the voltage over said capacitor. This can be seen in the following image.

\*The multimeter reads 3,56V
