## Battery System

The projects uses Li-ion batteries which operate at:

* A minimum voltage of 2,8V
* A maximum discharge current of 4400mA

The battery management system accommodates these specifications:

* A minimum voltage is provided through the use of a differential             amplifier, the reference voltage is provided by a zener diode.
* A maximum discharge current is safeguarded through the means of a DC-DC boost step-up converter. As this enables us to limit the maximum current, through the use of external passive components.
