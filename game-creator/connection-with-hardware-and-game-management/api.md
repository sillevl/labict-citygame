# API

* ### What is API

An application programming interface, also known as API, combines protocols, tools and a set of subroutine definitions. API makes it possible for aan app or computersystem to interchange information with the outside world. API's aren't a new feature at all, they are to be found in every pc. Without API we wouldn't be able to copy and paste text from a word document into an e-mail and so on.

All of this is possible because API shares a very limited information about the sending program's internal functions to the outside world. Because of this the application can share data and they can take actions on each others behalf without developpers requiring to share all their software's code.

* ### Most important APIs

APIs between software libraries are something we need on a daily basis, copy and pasting for instance would be impossible without this. it allows a seperation from its implementation so that programs written in one language can use libraries written in another.

There are also** System-level APIs** which make it possible for an application like LibreOffice or Word to run on an OS like windows. The Windows API is well known for being backwards compatible, so older applications will still work on newer versions of windows by putting it in the "Compatibility mode."

We ** **encounter** Web APIs **on a daily basis, if you go to a site which for example has a little google maps map with a marker where the store is located, all of this is made possible with Web APIs. It's really hard, even almost impossible, to find a website which doesn't make use of any Web APIs. It makes for way better and more user friendly sites.

* ### How can API be used

API can be used for everything that needs to send data from one
