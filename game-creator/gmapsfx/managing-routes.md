#**Routes**
## **How does it work?**

For routes to work you need atleast 2 markers/missions.
When you have 2 missions or more you can click the Create paths button which will create a route between the 2 missions. If there are more missions the path will go from mission 1 to mission 2 to mission 3 and so on.
