# Creating Games

At the beginning of the project, our intention was to create different types of games, and each one with a specific and proper functionality. But when it comes to implementing and designing the application to create the games we had a lot of problems. So we decided to tackle the problem from a different perspective and decided to focus on only one type of game. This game we call it Location Game.

### Location Game

This first game is based on the location of a point. The game is that one team go to a particular place and have to do a particular activity, for example make a puzzle. Therefore, the first problem how to place correctly the markers and  how to manage the markers on the map.  We have designed the application so the user who handled it could choose the point in the most comfortable and efficient way \(see paragraph Managing Markes and Dialog Windows\).

Once resolved this problem, we only had to give some importants parameters to mission, like a number of mission, a principal name, an objective, a radio and a specific location.

Once developed this idea, we decided to make each mission type Location Game, had the possibility to add more than one location per mission. We decided to add a button named "Other Mission" to add it.![](/assets/AddMission1.png)![](/assets/addMission2.png)We can see the popup window that appears when you click previously in "Other Location" and then click with the right button of the mouse on another point.![](/assets/import111.png)This is the final result that we obtain when we did the following steps.

### Key Switch Game

When we have just created the Location Game, we decided to create another game mode: Key Switch Game. This type of game is very similar to the previous, but his most important difference is that it may only have one location per mission. The main objective of this game is to find a key that works as a switch in the Hardware box.
