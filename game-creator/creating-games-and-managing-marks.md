# Creating Games

At the beginning of the project, our intention was to create different types of games, and each one with a specific and proper functionality. But when it comes to implementing and designing the application to create the games we had a lot of problems. So we decided to tackle the problem from a different perspective and decided to focus on only one type of game. This game we call it Location Game.
