# Creating Games

At the beginning of the project, our intention was to create different types of games, and each one with a specific and proper functionality. But when it comes to implementing and designing the application to create the games we had a lot of problems. So we decided to tackle the problem from a different perspective and decided to focus on only one type of game. This game we call it Location Game.

### Location Game

This first game is based on the location of a point. The game is that one team has to go to a particular place and do a particular activity, for example solve a puzzle. Therefore, the first problem we encountered was how to place the markers correctly and  how to manage the markers on the map. We have designed the application so the user who handled it could choose the point in the most comfortable and efficient way \(see paragraph Managing Markes and Dialog Windows\).

Once this problem was resolved, we only had to give some important parameters to mission, like a number of mission, a principal name, an objective, a radio and a specific location.

Once this idea was developed, we decided to make each mission type Location Game, had the possibility to add more than one location per mission. We decided to add a button named "Other Mission" to add it.![](/assets/AddMission1.png)![](/assets/addMission2.png)We can see the popup window that appears when you click previously in "Other Location" and then click with the right button of the mouse on another point.![](/assets/import111.png)This is the final result that we obtain when we did the following steps.

### Key Switch Game

When we have just created the Location Game, we decided to create another game mode: Key Switch Game. This type of game is very similar to the previous, but his most important difference is that it may only have one location per mission. The main objective of this game is to find a key that works as a switch in the Hardware box.

Now, raised to us a new question. How to select a mission or another and how to differentiate them on the map. We decided to create two buttons to select each mission, and we decided to put different icons for each mission \(the same as the Game Management team\).

Now we will see how it has been the final map  with some screenshots.

### Missions Java classes

Then we will see a representation of the UML language on the classes that make up the missions.![](/assets/MissionClasses.png)

We can see that we use the same class for both missions, since they share the same variables. On the other hand we have a component "MissionID" to know that mission is.

* If MissionID = 10 it belongs to LocationGame.
* If MissionID = 20, it belongs to Key Switch Game.

Each Mission class has an ArrayList of MissionLocations . Each MissionLocations class has variables about the position and radius \(latitude, longitude and radius\). The MissionLocations class is dependent on the class Mission. For each Mission should be at least one MissionLocations.
