# Creating Games

At the beginning of the project, our intention was to create different types of games, and each one with a specific and proper functionality. But when it comes to implementing and designing the application to create the games we had a lot of problems. So we decided to tackle the problem from a different perspective and decided to focus on only one type of game. This game we call it Location Game.

### Location Game

This first game is based on the location of a point. The game is go to a particular place and a particular activity, for example make a puzzle. Therefore, the first problem that we have faced, has been to place correctly and to manage the markers on the map so that the user who handled our application could choose the point of the most comfortable and efficient way \(see paragraph Managing Markes and Dialog Windows\).

Once resolved this problem, we only had to give way to the mission, with a number of mission, a name, a target, a radio and a specific location.
