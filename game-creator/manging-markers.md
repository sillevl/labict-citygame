# Managing Markers

Manage Google map markers, has been a hard work and difficult. We have had various problems, which we have been resolving throughout the project. We will now make a summary of how evolved, and the final result that we have achieved.

First we create a button to manually enter the longitude and latitude.  When we wrote a coordinate,  a marker appeared on the map in the corresponding point.

It worked, and we wanted to go further. We thought that it would be easier for the user to click on the screen to select the point. So, we decided when the user click with the right button at one point specific to the map, a marker will appear at the point of the map that was clicked.![](/assets/mapMarker1.png)
