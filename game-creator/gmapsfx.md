# **GmapsFX**
GMapsFX provides a wrapper to the Google Map's Javascript API, allowing you to use and interact with maps using a pure Java API. Below is an example of creating a new map component. Currently there is only support for a fraction of the Google Maps Javascript API, and the documentation is sparse, but this project has been opened sourced with the hope that as others need additional functionality it can be added to the API and contributed back to the community.
