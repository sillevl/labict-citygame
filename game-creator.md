# Game Creator

## Introduction

Game Creator has been designed and developed as an application to create the different games that belong to "VIVES CITY GAME". The main functions of this application are:

* Create a new game at a specific point on the map.
* Save and manage all the information related to the missions of orderly and clear.
* Create a path specified to get moving in a mission to another.
* Open a previously saved game.
* Save the game that we created \(the information will be in JSON format\)
* Transmit the information of the game \(JSON file\) to the hardware and Game Management.

## How to use the application

![](/assets/WelcomScene.png)The first step that we need to do to start the application is click on the button "File" which will only have one option available. That option is New, it let's you create a new game and lets you enter the following screen of the application.

After we press the option to make a new game, we will be entering the next screen of the application. In this Gamescene screen the user will spent most of its time setting up the game, choosing their team name and adding a description of the game.

The code which makes it possible for the game to be played with up to three teams is still in the project but unused.

After having set the number of teams from 0 to 1, a new button will appear on the screen. When this mission button is pressed a map will be loaded in a seperate window. The use and functions of this map will be explained later on in the chapter **Creating Games**.

In this Gamescene screen the Topbar will have unlocked all its options, each of these options do one of the following things:

* New: Create a new GamePacket for each Team and reset any previously made changes
